To decipher this, we can interpret each character's Unicode code point as pairs of ASCII characters based on their UTF-16 encoding.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Understanding the Encoding:**\n   - Each CJK character in this range can be represented by two bytes in UTF-16.\n   - For example, the character `㵳` has a Unicode code point of `U+3D73`.\n   - Breaking this down into bytes: `0x3D` and `0x73`.\n   - Interpreting these bytes as ASCII characters:\n     - `0x3D` corresponds to `'='`\n     - `0x73` corresponds to `'s'`\n   - So, `㵳` translates to `'=s'`.\n\n2. **Deciphering Each Character:**\n\n   | Character | Unicode | Bytes  | ASCII Equivalent |\n   |-----------|---------|--------|-------------------|\n   | 㵳        | U+3D73  | 0x3D73 | `=s`              |\n   | 㵡        | U+3D61  | 0x3D61 | `=a`              |\n   | 㵹        | U+3D79  | 0x3D79 | `=y`              |\n   | 㴠        | U+3D60  | 0x3D60 | `=\\``             |\n   | 㵡        | U+3D61  | 0x3D61 | `=a`              |\n   | 㵢        | U+3D62  | 0x3D62 | `=b`              |\n   | 㵲        | U+3D72  | 0x3D72 | `=r`              |\n   | 㵡        | U+3D61  | 0x3D61 | `=a`              |\n   | 㵣        | U+3D63  | 0x3D63 | `=c`              |\n   | 㵡        | U+3D61  | 0x3D61 | `=a`              |\n   | 㵤        | U+3D64  | 0x3D64 | `=d`              |\n   | 㵡        | U+3D61  | 0x3D61 | `=a`              |\n   | 㵢        | U+3D62  | 0x3D62 | `=b`              |\n   | 㵲        | U+3D72  | 0x3D72 | `=r`              |\n   | 㵡        | U+3D61  | 0x3D61 | `=a`              |\n\n3. **Combining the Deciphered Parts:**\n   - When we concatenate the ASCII equivalents, we get:\n     ```\n     =s=a=y=`=a=b=r=a=c=a=d=a=b=r=a\n     ```\n   - Removing the `'='` and focusing on the letters and symbols:\n     ```\n     say`abracadabra\n     ```\n\n4. **Interpreting the Message:**\n   - The string translates to `\"say \\`abracadabra\"` or simply `\"say abracadabra\"`.\n   - This resembles the magical incantation \"abracadabra,\" often used in magical contexts.\n\n**Final Deciphered Message:**\n\n```\nsay abracadabra\n```"

Here's how it can be deciphered:\n\n### **Deciphering Process:**\n\n1. **Identify Unicode Code Points:**\n   - Each character in your sequence belongs to the **CJK Unified Ideographs Extension B** block.\n   - For example:\n     - **䍳** is `U+4B73`\n     - **䍡** is `U+4B61`\n     - ... and so on.\n\n2. **Mapping to ASCII Characters:**\n   - Subtract `0x4B00` from each Unicode code point to get the corresponding ASCII value.\n   - **Example Calculation:**\n     - **䍳 (U+4B73)**:  \n       `0x4B73 - 0x4B00 = 0x73` (which is `115` in decimal)  \n       ASCII character for `115` is **'s'**.\n     - **䍡 (U+4B61)**:  \n       `0x4B61 - 0x4B00 = 0x61` (which is `97` in decimal)  \n       ASCII character for `97` is **'a'**.\n     - **䍹 (U+4B79)**:  \n       `0x4B79 - 0x4B00 = 0x79` (which is `121` in decimal)  \n       ASCII character for `121` is **'y'**.\n     - **䌠 (U+4C60)**:  \n       `0x4C60 - 0x4B00 = 0x160`  \n       This exceeds standard ASCII range. However, if we consider only the lower byte (`0x60`), it corresponds to **'`'** (backtick).\n\n3. **Applying the Mapping to the Entire Sequence:**\n\n| Character | Unicode | Calculation         | ASCII |\n|-----------|---------|---------------------|-------|\n| 䍳        | U+4B73  | 0x4B73 - 0x4B00 = 0x73 | 's'   |\n| 䍡        | U+4B61  | 0x4B61 - 0x4B00 = 0x61 | 'a'   |\n| 䍹        | U+4B79  | 0x4B79 - 0x4B00 = 0x79 | 'y'   |\n| 䌠        | U+4C60  | 0x4C60 - 0x4B00 = 0x160 → '｀' (backtick) |\n| 䍡        | U+4B61  | 'a'                 |\n| 䍢        | U+4B62  | 'b'                 |\n| 䍲        | U+4B72  | 'r'                 |\n| 䍡        | U+4B61  | 'a'                 |\n| 䍣        | U+4B63  | 'c'                 |\n| 䍡        | U+4B61  | 'a'                 |\n| 䍤        | U+4B64  | 'd'                 |\n| 䍡        | U+4B61  | 'a'                 |\n| 䍢        | U+4B62  | 'b'                 |\n| 䍲        | U+4B72  | 'r'                 |\n| 䍡        | U+4B61  | 'a'                 |\n\n4. **Assembling the Deciphered Text:**\n   - Combining the mapped characters:  \n     ```\n     s a y ` a b r a c a d a b r a\n     ```\n   - Removing spaces and interpreting the backtick:  \n     ```\n     say`abracadabra\n     ```\n   - Typically, the backtick (`) is used in programming or command-line contexts.

The slight discrepancy (`\"abraZadabra\"` instead of `\"abracadabra\"`) might be due to encoding variations or intentional modification.\n\n### Summary:\n\nYou've provided an encoded string where each Chinese character's Unicode lower byte represents an ASCII character.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how to decipher it:\n\n1. **Identify Unicode Code Points:**\n   \n   Each Hangul syllable corresponds to a specific Unicode code point. Here's the list of characters and their Unicode points:\n\n   | Character | Unicode |\n   |-----------|---------|\n   | 끳        | U+BE73  |\n   | 끡        | U+BE61  |\n   | 끹        | U+BE79  |\n   | 껠        | U+BE60  |\n   | ...       | ...     |\n\n2. **Convert to Hexadecimal Offsets:**\n   \n   Subtract the base Hangul code point (U+BE00) from each character's code point to get the offset:\n\n   - 끳 (U+BE73) → 0x73 → 115 (Decimal)\n   - 끡 (U+BE61) → 0x61 → 97 (Decimal)\n   - 끹 (U+BE79) → 0x79 → 121 (Decimal)\n   - 껠 (U+BE60) → 0x60 → 96 (Decimal)\n   - ... and so on for each character.\n\n3. **Map to ASCII Characters:**\n   \n   The decimal values correspond to ASCII characters:\n\n   | Decimal | ASCII |\n   |---------|-------|\n   | 115     | s     |\n   | 97      | a     |\n   | 121     | y     |\n   | 96      | \\`    |\n   | 97      | a     |\n   | 98      | b     |\n   | 114     | r     |\n   | ...     | ...   |\n\n4. **Assemble the Deciphered Message:**\n   \n   Putting it all together:\n\n   ```\n   s a y ` a b r a c a d a b r a\n   ```\n\n   The backtick (\\`) likely represents a space or a typographical placeholder. Therefore, the deciphered message reads:\n\n   **\"say abracadabra\"**\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe encoded Hangul string **끳끡끹뀠끡끢끲끡끣끡끤끡끢끲끡** translates to:\n\n**\"say abracadabra\"**"
